									<p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px">The HELP NEPAL Health Post in Murma, Mugu- one of the most remote districts in the country, was established in June 2004. Over the last 12 years, the health post has had a discernibly positive impact on the lives of not just the locals but also those of surrounding villages. Common ailments like pain, fever, gastrointestinal and seasonal diseases can now be treated locally. There has been a significant improvement in the quality of life and villagers donâ€™t have to walk two and a half hours to reach the government hospital in Gamgadhi anymore. Medicines at the health post typically cost half of what they cost at the pharmacies in Gamgadhi. The health post now provides services to more than 400 households.</p>

									<p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px">The HELP NEPAL Network Childrenâ€™s Home, has been running smoothly since August 2014 with financial support from Oz Bayldon, founder of Music4Children, UK and Dr. Franz Schmid from Switzerland. The home provides basic needs like food, clothes, shelter, education and health checkups to the children. The childrenâ€™s home started with 10 girls who were then admitted to the nearby Panchakanya School. Currently, there are seven part-time support staff and 12 girls studying in kindergarten to class six. In order to encourage saving habits, the home has opened child savings accounts with a monthly deposit of NRs. 25 for all the girls.</p>

                                   <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px">The girls can also deposit the money they earn during Dashain, Tihar, and other festivals. Children there celebrate different festivals like Chhath, Yomari Purnima, Dashain, Tihar, Christmas, New Year and Lhosar. The home also organizes extra-curricular activities such as a one-day trip to Shiva statue in Sanga, Bhaktapur, picnics and zoo visits.</p>
